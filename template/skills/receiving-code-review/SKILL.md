# Code Review Reception

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Fetch feedback → Verify → Implement → Re-test → Push updates.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the Nori Receiving Code Review skill to handle this feedback."

## Process

### Step 0: Create task list

For multi-item feedback, add every item and the final verification to your task
list. This prevents omissions and makes progress visible.

### Step 1: Fetch PR Comments

Use the PR number from context, or resolve it from the current branch:

```bash
gh pr view --json number -q .number
gh pr view [PR-NUMBER] --comments
```

Read all review and general comments before reacting.

### Step 2: Understand and Clarify

For each item, confirm that you can restate the requirement, that it is sound
for this codebase, that it preserves existing behavior, and that you understand
why the current implementation exists.

**CRITICAL:** If ANY item is unclear, STOP. Ask for clarification on ALL unclear items before implementing ANYTHING.

```
User: "Fix items 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

✅ "Understand 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before implementing."
❌ Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
```

### Step 3: Implement Changes

1. Blocking issues (breaks, security)
2. Simple fixes (typos, imports)
3. Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)

Implement, test, and commit each fix individually.

**YAGNI check:** If reviewer suggests "implementing properly", grep for actual usage:

```bash
grep -r "endpointName" .
```

If unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"

### Step 4: Run Tests, Lint, and Format

Run the project's tests, type checks, formatter, and linter. Fix failures and
inspect the final diff before proceeding. Follow the relevant verification
steps from `{{skills_dir}}/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md`.

### Step 5: Push Updates

Push the changes to the PR.

### Step 6: Summary and Next Action

Use this format:

```
Code review feedback addressed:

- Fixed [item 1]: [brief description]
- Fixed [item 2]: [brief description]

Verification: [tests, type checks, formatting, and linting performed]
Changes pushed to PR.

Next:
1. Done — ready for re-review
2. More feedback — address additional changes
3. Show changes — review the final diff
```

## Review Principles

- Verify suggestions against the codebase instead of assuming the reviewer is
  correct. Push back with technical reasoning when a suggestion breaks behavior,
  conflicts with prior decisions, fails on a supported platform, or violates
  YAGNI.
- Avoid performative agreement such as "You're absolutely right," "Great
  point," or "Thanks for..." State the requirement or fix factually.
- If evidence disproves your pushback, state what you checked and proceed:
  "You were right—checked [X], and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
- If you are uncomfortable pushing back, say: "Strange things are afoot at the
  Circle K."
