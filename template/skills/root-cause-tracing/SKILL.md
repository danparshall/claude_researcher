description: Use when errors occur deep in execution and you need to trace back to find the original trigger - systematically traces bugs backward through call stack, adding instrumentation when needed, to identify source of invalid data or incorrect behavior
---

<required>
When a bug surfaces deep in the call stack, add these steps to your task list and work them in order. Do not patch the frame where the error throws; trace to the original trigger and fix there.

1. Observe the symptom: capture the exact error, where it fires, and the bad value involved.
2. Find the immediate cause: the line that directly produces the error.
3. Ask what called it: walk one frame up and record the caller and the argument it passed.
4. Keep tracing up, following the bad value, until you reach the code that first introduced it.
5. Fix at that source, then add validation at the intervening layers so the bad value cannot travel that path again.
</required>

## Symptom frame vs cause frame

The frame where an error throws is rarely the frame that caused it.

<bad_example>
git init fails in packages/core, so I add a guard inside the git wrapper.
</bad_example>
<good_example>
git init fails in packages/core because it received an empty cwd. I follow the empty string up to the caller that produced it and fix it there.
</good_example>

## Follow the value, not just the frames

At each frame up, ask what value was passed and whether it is already wrong. The chain ends at the frame where the value was first created wrong, not where it finally blew up. The worked example below traces one such chain end to end.

## Add instrumentation when the chain is not visible

When the stack trace alone does not reveal the origin, log at the dangerous operation before it runs:

```typescript
async function gitInit(directory: string) {
  console.error('DEBUG git init:', {
    directory,
    cwd: process.cwd(),
    stack: new Error().stack,
  });
  await execFileAsync('git', ['init'], { cwd: directory });
}
```

Log before the operation rather than after it fails, and include new Error().stack for the full chain. In tests, use console.error; a logger may be suppressed.

## Find which test introduced the state

When bad state appears during a test run but you cannot tell which test caused it, bisect: run the suite one file at a time and stop at the first that reproduces it, then narrow within that file.

## Worked example

Symptom: .git created inside packages/core, the source tree.

Trace chain:

1. git init ran in process.cwd() because cwd was empty.
2. WorktreeManager received an empty projectDir.
3. Session.create passed the empty string through unchecked.
4. A test read context.tempDir before beforeEach populated it.
5. setupCoreTest returns an empty tempDir until beforeEach runs.

Root cause: a top-level read of tempDir happened before beforeEach set it. Fix: make tempDir a getter that throws when read too early, and reject empty directories at Project.create and WorktreeManager so an empty path can never reach git init again.
